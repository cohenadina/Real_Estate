# Real_Estate

Real Estate website.
On the backend, I have developed agents, properties, contacts and images.
I developed a front end to administer the real estate project which allows an
admin user to add, update, and delete various aspects of the properties. The
client can search for properties to buy, sell or rent using various filters. A
client may also sign up for the newsletter.
The client side is written in HTML, CSS, bootstrap, JQuery, JavaScript.
The Server side is written using PHP, SQL database.
Git is used for source control.
